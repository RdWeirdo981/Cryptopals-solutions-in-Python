# Cryptopals-solutions-in-Python

My personal practice solutions of Cryptopals Challenges in Python.

I sort of abandon the Java solutions repo because: 1) I personally think Python is way more suitable for Cryptoanalysis. 2) I'm more familiar with Python. The previous project is just for me practicing Java.
